## Question

Is it possible that humans might forget how to set up the internet back up in case of a solar wind disaster?

## Answer

It is possible that humans might forget how to set up the internet back up in case of a solar wind disaster. This is because the knowledge required to set up the internet infrastructure is complex and requires specialized technical knowledge, as well as access to specialized tools and equipment.

In addition, the way we set up and maintain the internet is constantly evolving, with new technologies and protocols being developed all the time. If a solar wind disaster were to occur and cause widespread disruption to the internet infrastructure, it is possible that some of the knowledge and equipment needed to restore it might be lost or destroyed, making it more difficult to rebuild the network.

That being said, there are many experts and organizations working on disaster recovery and preparedness plans to help mitigate the effects of such an event, and it is likely that some of this knowledge and expertise would be preserved and passed on to future generations to help prevent a catastrophic loss of the internet.

## Question

Is there any Israeli or Israel-based organizations working on internet disaster recovery and preparedness?

## Answer

Yes, there are several Israeli organizations working on internet disaster recovery and preparedness. Some examples include the Israel National Cyber Directorate (INCD), CyberArk, Check Point, NSO Group, and Magen David Adom (MDA). These organizations provide a range of cybersecurity and disaster recovery solutions to help protect critical infrastructure and prepare for potential threats.

## Question

How often do solar winds that can have effects on Earth's magnetosphere and can cause disruption to satellites and power grids occur?

## Answer

The most severe solar storms, which can have significant effects on Earth's magnetosphere and cause disruptions to satellites and power grids, occur on average about once every 11 years, coinciding with the peak of the solar cycle. The last peak in solar activity occurred in 2014, and the next peak is expected in 2025.

It's worth noting that while solar storms can cause disruptions to technology on Earth, most modern systems are designed with some level of resilience to mitigate the effects of space weather. Additionally, there are organizations such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that monitor space weather and issue alerts when severe solar storms are expected.
